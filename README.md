# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# Not Another Web Server
The server with no delusions of grandeur.

# Features

* Serves static files (e.g. web page, image, e-book).
* Serves output of executable and python scripts.

# Limitations
* IPv4 (and nothing else).
* Accepts (only) connections from your home network.
* Handles a single connection at a time.

# Roadmap

* HTTPS, so I can use it outside my home network.
